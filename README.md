## Kick off the testing
As you know, evaluation on the entire dataset takes time. For testing on a random subset, I implemented a random index generation layer. See screenshot **"figs/test_d64_rand.png"**, **"figs/test_d32_rand.png"**, **"figs/test_d16_rand.png"** for details.

I should claim that this is just for fun, please do not not take it seriously. You might get, say, **68.2 mm** and **68.4 mm** in two different runs.

- **d2 =  64**
  ```
  cd testing
  caffe test -model test_d64_rand.prototxt -weights models/net_iter_720929.caffemodel -iterations 500
  ```
  This will give you **figs/rand_test_d64.png** (unstable number around **68 mm** due to small number of samples)
  
- **d2 =  32**
  ```
  caffe test -model test_d32_rand.prototxt -weights models/net_iter_640000.caffemodel -iterations 500
  ```
  This will give you **figs/rand_test_d32.png** (unstable number around **71 mm**)
  
- **d2 =  16**
  ```
  caffe test -model test_d16_rand.prototxt -weights models/net_iter_560000.caffemodel -iterations 500
  ```
  This will give you **figs/rand_test_d16.png** (unstable number around **74 mm**)

## Full testing
For full evaluation on H36M test set
 
- **d2 =  64**
  ```
  cd testing
  caffe test -model test_d16_statsfalse.prototxt -weights models/net_iter_720929.caffemodel -iterations 183000
  ```
  This will give you mm (**figs/test_d64_full.png**)


- **d2 =  32**
  ```
  caffe test -model test_d32_statsfalse.prototxt -weights models/net_iter_640000.caffemodel -iterations 183000
  ```
  This will give you **68.6 mm** (**figs/test_d32_full.png**)
 
  
- **d2 =  16**
  ```
  caffe test -model test_d16_statsfalse.prototxt -weights models/net_iter_560000.caffemodel -iterations 183000
  ```
  This will give you **73.6 mm** (**figs/test_d16_full.png**)

## Training

Training is a bit tricky. For a comprehensive interpretation, see pdf. Here's the thing:

- I started with **d2 =  2** to warm up. Simply run 
  ```
  cd training 
  caffe train --solver=solver_d2.prototxt 
  ```
  I trained from scratch w/o MPII 2D HM pretraining, with **2.5e-5** as base_lr and **RMSProp**. 2 GPUs were used unless otherwise specified. Weight initialization is gaussian w/ **0.01 std**. Loss ratio of 3d HM to 2d HM is **0.1:1**.
  
- **d2 =  4** Finetune weights from **d2 =  2** after convergence.
  ```
  caffe train --solver=solver_d4.prototxt --snapshot=net_iter_XXX.solverstate 
  ```
  You will get around **137 mm** on train and **150 mm** on test. For eval on training set, simply uncomment **"index_lower_bound: 0" "index_upper_bound: 1559571"** of **"GenRandIndex"** layer. Loss ratio is **0.3:1**.
 
- **d2 =  8** Finetune weights from **d2 =  4** after convergence.
  ```
  caffe train --solver=solver_d8.prototxt --snapshot=net_iter_XXX.solverstate 
  ```
  You will get around **72 mm** on train and **86 mm** on test. Loss ratio is **0.1:1**.
- **d2 =  16** Finetune weights from **d2 =  8** after convergence 
  ```
  caffe train --solver=solver_d16.prototxt --snapshot=net_iter_XXX.solverstate 
  ```
  You will get around **47 mm** on train and **72 mm** on test. Loss ratio is **0.03:1**.

- **d2 =  32** Finetune weights from **d2 =  16** after net_iter_560000.solverstate 
  ```
  caffe train --solver=solver_d32.prototxt --snapshot=net_iter_560000.solverstate 
  ```
  You will get around **39 mm** on train and **71 mm** on test. Loss ratio is **0.03:1**.
  I changed the weight initialization of 3D heatmap to normal distribution with **0.001 std** in place previous 0.01 as I found the MPJPE error did not slump.
  
- **d2 =  64** Finetune weights from **d2 =  32** after net_iter_640000.solverstate 
  ```
  caffe train --solver=solver_d64.prototxt --snapshot=net_iter_640000.solverstate 
  ```
  You will get around **37 mm** on train and **68 mm** on test. Loss ratio is **0.03:1**. I again changed weight initialization of 3D heatmap from 0.001 gaussian $\rightarrow$ **0.0003**. 
  
This sounds pretty sketchy, right? Another way to train this is simply train **d1 = 1, d2 = 64** from scratch. Details:
\emph{missing, TO DO}

### Notes:

- I set **use_global_stats** to **false** during inference due to small batch size, otherwise you would get a totally different MPJPE number. I cannot recall the paper that mentioned it. Let me find the paper.

- The major differences between prototxts are

   **a)** depth dimension param (Use sublime or notepad++ to search keywords **"depth_dims"**)
   
   **b)** 3d heatmap slicing layer. (Simply search **"cube_"**)
   
   **c)** 3d heatmap reshaping layer (**"heatmap2_flat_scale"**)
   
   **d)** loss ratio of 3d heatmap and 2d heatmap. Basic rule is magnitude of these two losses should be the same.
   
   **e)** different weight initialization of last conv layer for 3d heatmap.
   
- I only used **L2 loss** during training. Nevertheless I have **smooth L1 loss**, **adaptive loss**, and **integral loss** in prototxt, as can be seen in figs/*.png. Adaptive loss tries to automatically balance weight magnitude of different euclidean regression loss. See pdf for details about integral loss.

- MPJPE error of **argmax** operation is **"error(mm)_3d_s2_max"**.
